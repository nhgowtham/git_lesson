# Introduction

Measurement of residual stress in benchmark samples

Neutron diffraction is used to measure the residual stress (Withers et al)

Smith et al (2002) conducted benchmarking of neutron diffraction of weld samples as part of NeT project

The benchmarking for residual stress is helps in standardization of 
the measurement technique.

Also, the aim is for industry to adopt the residual stress measurement 
which are diffraction based.

# Simulations
The residual stress produced from the applied load on the U flexure 
is calculated using FEM simulations.

Add figures to the draft
# Results
The residual stresses from neutron diffraction and SXRD were statistically close
enough
Blah novel results blah
