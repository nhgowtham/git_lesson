#Introduction

Measurement of residual stress in benchmark samples

Neutron diffraction is used to measure the residual stress (Withers et al)

Smith et al (2002) conducted benchmarking of neutron diffraction of weld samples as part of NeT project

The benchmarking for residual stress is helps in standardization of 
the measurement technique.

Also, the aim is for industry to adopt the residual stress measurement 
which are diffraction based.

Synchrotron x-ray diffraction is also used to measure the residual stress.

#Simulations
The residual stress produced from the applied load on the U flexure 
is calculated using FEM simulations.
